== Research Interests

I am interested in statistical machine learning and online learning. Recently I have been working on learning under distribution shift.

== News

- Our paper "Model Assessment and Selection under Temporal Distribution Shift" is posted on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08672 arXiv]!
- Our paper "A Stability Principle for Learning under Non-Stationarity" is posted on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18304 arXiv]!
- We (Kaizheng Wang, Yuhang Wu and I) won second place in the [https://sites.google.com/view/dmdaworkshop2023/data-challenge 2023 INFORMS Blue Summit Supplies Data Challenge]! We also ranked first in the two-week live test of pricing and profit forecasting.
